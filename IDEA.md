# Ju Office

## Concept
- Idea Name: `Ju Office`
- Core Concept: A virtual startup company machine with an `llm` agents team.
- Organizational Structure: Same structure as a real startup office.
- Scope Direction: It is much more similar with a company, not only for ochestra.
- Real Output Principle: Although this may seem like a game, agents actually produce real results in the office.
- Development Requirement: When developing a Ju Office, it is necessary to study the operation methods of actual startups and establish an efficient operating method system.

## Platform and Workflow
- Codebase Foundation: Ju Office has a fork mirror of `oh-my-codex` (`omx`): `https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex.git`.
- Skill Usage: It uses the `autopilot` skill in `omx`.
- Key Difference: It has a UI on the GitHub page.
- Collaboration Model: The agents use GitHub for co-work.
- AI Usage Method: Agent AI is used by executing Codex CLI like OMX rather than using an API.
- First Command: The first Ju Office command is `start [startup goal]`.
- Initial Workflow: First it makes git and pulls.
- Agent GitHub Flow: Agents may pull to GitHub.
- State Visibility: We can see the state on GitHub Pages.

## Roles and Authority
- User Role: The user is an investor.
- Investor Authority: The investor can give the CEO the direction of the company and what they want to do.
- Investor Position: The investor is god to them.

## CEO Governance and Organization
